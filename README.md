# CycleGAN - Apples and Oranges

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of **CycleGAN** for image-to-image translation between **apples** and **oranges**. The dataset is divided into four folders: **train A**, **train B**, **test A**, and **test B**, representing apples and oranges for training and testing, respectively.

For detailed information on the project, including model architecture and results, please refer to **CycleGAN_Gyuhwan Choi.pdf**.

## Folder Structure:
- **train A**: Training images for domain A (apples)
- **train B**: Training images for domain B (oranges)
- **test A**: Testing images for domain A (apples)
- **test B**: Testing images for domain B (oranges)
